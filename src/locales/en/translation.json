The labour market, therefore, is an important factor that affects the ability of acquiring a high-quality workforce. No company can ignore the changing factors that affect the labour supply but instead must continuously monitor changes and trends, and labour market developments. The labour market is creating new forms of employment, given that companies must respond timely to changes in business. International business operations impose additional challenges for businesses which, in order to survive in new markets, must become familiar with the business requirements and the characteristics of the new market."
